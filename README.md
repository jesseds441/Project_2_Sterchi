Output Files
Output.txt - Output to where all the strain DNA sequences are written to
Output_Comp.txt - Output list of dicts of the ratio of unmatched nucleotides to matched nucleotide rates and matched nucleotides of all strains for one given sequence
export.csv - Generated table of the ratio of unmatched nucleotides to matched nucleotide rates and a string of matched nucleotides of all strains for one given sequence
export_all.csv - Generated table of the ratio of unmatched nucleotides to matched nucleotide rates  of all strains for all sequences.
export_averages.csv - Generated a table containing the average ratio of unmatched to matched nucleotides for all strains across one given sequence
